# get_next_line

The goal of this project is to create the function _get_next_line.c_ which, when called in a loop, will then allow the available text in the file descriptor to be read one line at a time until the end of the file. The program must compile with the flag-D BUFFER_SIZE=xx which will be used as the buffer size for the read calls in get_next_line.

Get_next_line is a simple and challenging project to learn deeply about open(), read() and close() functions as well as static variables and file descriptors.
