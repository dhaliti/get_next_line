# get_next_line

The goal of this project is to create the function _get_next_line.c_ which will read the file descriptor passed as an argument line by line. The program must be compiled with _-D BUFFER_SIZE=xx_ to set the size of the function's buffer.

Get_next_line is a simple and challenging project to learn deeply about open(), read() and close() functions as well as static variables and file descriptors.
